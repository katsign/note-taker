## *Description*
Note Taker uses an Express server to store input user data in a database and display it on a landing page. Simply put ‚Äî you can write and display notes!

## *Installation*
### Navigate into the repository folder on your local machine and open the built-in terminal. You will need Node.js installed to run this application.
- Type `npm i` on the command line to install Express.
- Type `node server.js` to spin up the local server.
- Then, type `npm run watch` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to see the application in action.

## *Usage*
### Note Taker allows you to view both the posted input data as listed 'Notes' and those actual JSON objects in the database at different endpoints in the app.
- From the homepage, when you click `Get Started` you are taken to the `/notes` endpoint. This displays the two test notes already saved in the database and an interface to begin typing a new `Note Title` and `Note Text`.
- Write your new note and click the save icon that appears up top to post to the database. This will also append to the list of notes on the left.
- To view the JSON objects, type this path into your browser while running the local server: `http://localhost:3000/api/notes`.
